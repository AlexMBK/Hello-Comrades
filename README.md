# Hello-Comrades
This is the Repository I will be keeping my school work in for CS50 Intro to Computer Science.

My name is Alex, my pronouns are they/them.
I have taken an introduction to programing course earlier in the year but found it difficult as I am still very new to computer sciences and I knew very little. I have learned alot since the first course and want to try to keep learning.
If anyone stumble upon this please feel free to help me in anyway as all help is appreciated.
